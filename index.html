                                <p>We are the Domingo family — a home filled with laughter, learning, occasional chaos (the fun kind!), and lots of love. You'll quickly discover that we value open communication, mutual respect, and finding joy in the little things. We believe that a strong relationship with our au pair is built on trust, kindness, and shared experiences — not just schedules and routines.</p>
